### This is a full nvim IDE integration with `vim-plug` based on [breezy](https://github.com/fneu/breezy)

This is my fun little project, I wanted nvim a theme for kde-plasma so I wanted share my current seutp.
Currently it's depending on:
- vim-plug (AUR)
- nerd-fonts-inconsolata (AUR)

Make sure to symlink `init.vim` -> `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim` if you are installing the init file somewhere else.
You have to run `:PlugInstall` after launching nvim for the first time to install all the required vim-plugins
